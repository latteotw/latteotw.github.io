However,<br>you will find a lot intersections between data structure and algorithms. For example,<br>in order to solve an array problem, you might have to use the knowledge of binary<br>search. Therefore, I will try to not include questions that rely on knowledge about<br>topics that we have not covered yet. However, I will keep a note on my end to make<br>sure that we re-visit those problems after we cover the topics. After we visit every<br>topic, all the dots will be connected.</p><p>There are some topics that I didn’t include in above list because they have less frequencies<br>though they are equally important as those problems with higher frequencies. For<br>example: Trie, Segment tree, Ordered map and etc. I will still cover these topics<br>at the time when I think I am ready.</p><p>I will create a folder(category) and also tag for each of the topics. You can either<br>browse by category, tag or simply search in the search box.</p>]]></content>

For each question,<br>they will be approached in a various aspects:<ul><li>Problem set</li><li>Problem set analysis</li><li>Thinking process</li><li>Brutal force / First solution</li><li>Improvements</li><li>Answer analysis: time/space complexities</li><li>Take aways: conclusions, templates, programming related takeaways such as the<br>usage of a given data structure.</li></ul></li><li>I will draw a knowledge graph that can represent the structure of all the<br>problems and their underlying data structure and algorithms that we have processed<br>so that readers can get a general idea of the big picture of data structures and algorithms.<h1 id="Pre-requisites"><a href="#Pre-requisites" class="headerlink" title="Pre-requisites"></a>Pre-requisites</h1></li><li><strong>Basic knowledge of Python.</strong> We will use Python3 and I will also try to cover some<br>basic programming knowledge about Python</li><li><strong>Leetcode access.</strong> You can register it for free.</li><li><strong>Basic knowledge of data structures</strong> like array, strings, hashmap and etc. I won’t<br>assume any advanced knowledge of complicated data structure such as tree and graph.<br>Knowledge of algorithms are not required as learning them together is the main purpose<br>of this blog.</li></ul><h1 id="Discussion"><a href="#Discussion" class="headerlink" title="Discussion"></a>Discussion</h1><p>As I will try my best effort to make my post as accurate as possible, I would also<br>appreciate your feedback for any questions and improvements.
