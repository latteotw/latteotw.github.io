        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Purpose"><a href="#Purpose" class="headerlink" title="Purpose"></a>Purpose</h1><p>I started writing this blog as a memo for my coding interview preparation process.<br>At the mean while, I hope readers can find useful contents in this blog, either<br>you are preparing for coding interview the same as me, or just hoping to sharp your<br>data structures and algorithms.</p><h1 id="Approaches"><a href="#Approaches" class="headerlink" title="Approaches"></a>Approaches</h1><ul><li>I will use <a href="https://leetcode.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leetcode</a> as my main source of coding questions and answering templates.</li><li>I will try to complete selected questions by tags in Leetcode. For each question,<br>they will be approached in a various aspects:<ul><li>Problem set</li><li>Problem set analysis</li><li>Thinking process</li><li>Brutal force / First solution</li><li>Improvements</li><li>Answer analysis: time/space complexities</li><li>Take aways: conclusions, templates, programming related takeaways such as the<br>usage of a given data structure.</li></ul></li><li>I will draw a knowledge graph that can represent the structure of all the<br>problems and their underlying data structure and algorithms that we have processed<br>so that readers can get a general idea of the big picture of data structures and algorithms.</li></ul><h1 id="Pre-requisites"><a href="#Pre-requisites" class="headerlink" title="Pre-requisites"></a>Pre-requisites</h1><ul><li><strong>Basic knowledge of Python.</strong> We will use Python3 and I will also try to cover some<br>basic programming knowledge about Python</li><li><strong>Leetcode access.</strong> You can register it for free.</li><li><strong>Basic knowledge of data structures</strong> like array, strings, hashmap and etc. I won’t<br>assume any advanced knowledge of complicated data structure such as tree and graph.<br>Knowledge of algorithms are not required as learning them together is the main purpose<br>of this blog.</li></ul><h1 id="Discussion"><a href="#Discussion" class="headerlink" title="Discussion"></a>Discussion</h1><p>As I will try my best effort to make my post as accurate as possible, I would also<br>appreciate your feedback for any questions and improvements. You can use the discussion<br>section under each question to interact with me and other readers.</p><h1 id="Q-amp-A"><a href="#Q-amp-A" class="headerlink" title="Q&amp;A"></a>Q&amp;A</h1><ul><li>When will I update the blog?<ul><li>I will try to update it on a daily basis but there will for sure be gaps.</li></ul></li><li>What’s your practicing order for Leetcode tags?<ul><li>I will post another follow up blog to talk about my plans for practicing with<br>Leetcode.</li></ul></li><li>Will system designs be discussed?<ul><li>Yes but it will come after the data structure and algorithms.</li></ul></li></ul></br><p>- latteotw</p><p>- Nobody said it was easy. No one ever said it would be this hard.</p>]]></content>
