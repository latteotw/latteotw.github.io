Approaches I will use Leetcode as my main source of coding questions and answering templates. I will try to complete selected questions by tags in Leetcode. For each question,they will be approached in a various aspects: Problem set Problem set analysis Thinking process Brutal force / First solution Improvements Answer analysis: time/space complexities Take aways: conclusions, templates, programming related takeaways such as theusage of a given data structure. I will draw a knowledge graph that can represent the structure of all theproblems and their underlying data structure and algorithms that we have processedso that readers can get a general idea of the big picture of data structures and algorithms. Pre-requisites Basic knowledge of Python. We will use Python3 and I will also try to cover somebasic programming knowledge about Python Leetcode access. You can register it for free. Basic knowledge of data structures like array, strings, hashmap and etc. I won’tassume any advanced knowledge of complicated data structure such as tree and graph.Knowledge of algorithms are not required as learning them together is the main purposeof this blog. DiscussionAs I will try my best effort to make my post as accurate as possible, I would alsoappreciate your feedback for any questions and improvements. You can use the discussionsection under each question to interact with me and other readers. Q&amp;A When will I update the blog? I will try to update it on a daily basis but there will for sure be gaps. What’s your practicing order for Leetcode tags? I will post another follow up blog to talk about my plans for practicing withLeetcode. Will system designs be discussed? Yes but it will come after the data structure and algorithms. - latteotw - Nobody said it was easy. No one ever said it would be this hard.","categories":[{"name":"Misc","slug":"Misc","permalink":"https://latteotw.github.io/categories/Misc/"},{"name":"General","slug":"Misc/General","permalink":"https://latteotw.github.io/categories/Misc/General/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Misc","slug":"Misc","permalink":"https://latteotw.github.io/tags/Misc/"}]}]}
